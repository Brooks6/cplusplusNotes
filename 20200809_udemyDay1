//Modern C++ and the C++ Standard
  1.classical C++: pre c++11 standard
    modern C++: 1)c++11: lots of new features
                2)c++14: smaller changes
                3)c++17: simplification
              
//how does it all work
  1.the c++ build process: source code (compiler)-> object code (linker) -> c++ standard library or other libraries 
  2.source code = .cpp files
  3.object code = .obj files
  4.IDE = integrated development environments 
 
//compiler warnings
  1.the compiler has recognized an issue with your code that could lead to a potential problem
  2.it's only a warning because the compiler is still able to generate correct machine code

//linker errors
  1.the linker is having trouble linking all the object files together to create an executable
  2.usually there is a library or object file that is missing
